# Unnamed Weather Radar App.
New app designed to show Level II NOAA radar data. Reflectivity or Velocity, it has it.

# Available Modes

Level I/II

All the S-band WSR-88D radar images are available to be seen.
Live updates.

# Fees

User: 0$

SKYWARN Spotter Features: 3$/month

Anddd the rest is vice versa.
The program itself is free. There is no need to pay, or do something to get the software.

# Detection

As the NWS says, Doppler Radar **DOES NOT** pick up most particles of mist, fog, or light snow. So do not tell me the software is getting the imagery wrong.

# Development

I nearly have NO free time, so I will take a deadass long while to develop this.
